# Brain-Tumor-Classification

We have trained a **Convolutional Neural Network** to process Brain MRI scans to find out if there is a presence of a tumor or not.

**Model Arch:**

**Total params:** 440,100

**Trainable params:** 439,844

**Non-trainable params:** 256

The types of Brain tumors which can be classified by this model are:
  1. 'glioma_tumor'
  2. 'meningioma_tumor'
  3. 'no_tumor'
  4. 'pituitary_tumor'
  
We have achieved **training**, **validation** and **testing accuracy** of 87.12%, 74.65% and 79.17% respectively.
