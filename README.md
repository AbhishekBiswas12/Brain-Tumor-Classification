# Brain-Tumor-Classification

We have trained a **Convolutional Neural Network** to process Brain MRI scans to find out if there is a presence of a tumor or not.

**Model Arch:**

**Total params:** 463,748

**Trainable params:** 463,172

**Non-trainable params:** 576

The types of Brain tumors which can be classified by this model are:
  1. 'glioma_tumor'
  2. 'meningioma_tumor'
  3. 'no_tumor'
  4. 'pituitary_tumor'
  
We have achieved **training**, **validation** and **testing accuracy** of 93%, 85.8% and 86% respectively.
